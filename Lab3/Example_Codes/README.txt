This directory contains 6 examples of modelling in CPLEX OPL.

First example Sample1, contains the model of a simple LP.
Note that if the problem provided is unbounded or infeasible, there won't be any log in Solution tab. Engine tab would be conveying the problem type.
However you can get the problem status through postprocessing.

Second example Sample2, introduces to data files and post processing.

Third example Sample3, explains how you can control the flow of the model using "main".
This examples shows using functions to generate values and runs the same model for each value generated.

Fourth example Sample4, is the modelling for Shortest Path of a graph shown in class.

Fifth example Sample5, is the matrix modelling for Shortest Path problem (for a graph different from the one used in the class).

The last example Tutorial1 is the LP modelled in the tutorial.
